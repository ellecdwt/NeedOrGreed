This is a WoW addon to track required items for specified recipes.
This will allow the player to specify recipes to track and will alert the player when ingredients
for those recipes are looted. Ideally this will be across toons and will also incorporate a general
"what uses this?" option to show what recipes use the selected item. May also include an auction house
price for the item to help determine whether to vendor or to save for AH.
